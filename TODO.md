TODO List:
* Implement some kind of changelog automation.
* Implement automatic versioning.
* Implement release pipeline on release branches. This pipeline should execute without being a prerelease like main.
* Migrate to https://github.com/sashirestela/simple-openai
* Add the ability to configure more than one assistant and register different parts of the system.
* Implement code scanning like Qodana or similar tool.
